            Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokovvlɐ, also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin,
             was an expatriate Russian and Russian-American novelist, poet, translator, and entomologist.
              Born in Imperial Russia in 1899, Nabokov wrote his first nine novels in Russian (1926–1938)
               while living in Berlin, where he met his wife. He achieved international acclaim and 
               prominence after moving to the United States,
             where he began writing in English. Nabokov became an American citizen in 1945 and 
             lived mostly on the East Coast before returning to Europe in 1961, 
             where he settled in Montreux, Switzerland.

From 1948 to 1959, Nabokov was a professor of Russian literature at Cornell University.

Nabokov's 1955 novel Lolita ranked fourth on Modern Library's list of the 100 best 
20th-century novels in 2007 and is considered one of the greatest 20th-century works of 
literature. Nabokov's Pale Fire, published in 1962, was ranked 53rd on the same list.
 His memoir, Speak, Memory, published in 1951, 
 is considered among the greatest nonfiction works of the 20th century, 
 placing eighth on Random House's ranking of 20th century works.
  Nabokov was a seven-time finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction. 
  He also was an expert lepidopterist and composer of chess problems.
